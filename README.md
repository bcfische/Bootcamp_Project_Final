<b>The Effect of crime rate on Airbnb </b>.

The project idea is to check whether the crime rate of a particular neighborhood influences the pricing and business for Airbnb. Chose the city of Chicago for the project.

Data Munging

Used machine learning libraries to analyze the data and use it for data visualization. We chose 2 datasets for this project,
the first from insideairbnb.com and the second from data.cityofchicago.org. The former represents detailed listing and review data of Chicago properties, compiled from Airbnb by an independent website. The latter represents crime data compiled and distributed by the city of Chicago. 

Transformation

The machine learning aspect of the project involved the use of regression and sentiment analysis to analyze user reviews for a certain neighborhood and verify if it influences the business. The visualization is done in Tableau.
