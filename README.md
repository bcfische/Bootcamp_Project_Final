How Safe is AirBnb in Chicago?

For this project, we were asked to employ machine learning in a data visualization problem. We chose 2 datasets for this project,
the first from insideairbnb.com and the second from data.cityofchicago.org. The former represents detailed listing and review data
of Chicago properties, compiled from Airbnb by an independent website. The latter represents crime data compiled and distributed by
the city of Chicago. The machine learning aspect of the project involved the use of regression and sentiment analysis, while the
visualization was done in Tableau.
